Unpacked/Optimized version of UT1 Blacklists

See original version here: https://dsi.ut-capitole.fr/blacklists/index_en.php

Optimizations:

- Split IP-Addresses off into their own file (ips)
- Unduplicate and make domains inclusive of subdomains (remove redundant sub-domains)
- Make all domains lower-case
- Filter out invalid (syntax) domains (domains.invalid)
- Filter out URLs that can be used as domains (urls.domains)
- Remove empty files

Where original files are modified they are backupped/retained and given the .original file-name extension.
